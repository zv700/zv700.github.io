    <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hi! My name is Zach. I enjoy learning new skills and self-improvement. Regardless of the type of work or the setting,
            I'm here to work hard and grow. I want to be better today than I was yesterday.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Then</h2>
          <p>Previously, I worked as an educator. At my last position, I was a "Swiss army knife" in the classroom. 
          As everyone's designated co-teacher, I learned to teach every subject under the sun, from math and science to law and graphic design.
          If there were students who needed support, it didn't matter the subject or grade level; I'm there.</p>
          
          <p>You give me 24 hours. I'm gathering information. I'm teaching myself what students learned yesterday, what they're learning today, tomorrow, and what they're learning next week.
          I'll come in the next day and teach the class. The main teacher provides a route for students to get from point A to point B that may not be accessable by everyone.
          I was there to provide an alternate route; a different perspective when explaining things or different methods to reach the same goal/understanding. My co-teachers and I collaborated and shared ideas
          because a goal that many educators strive to fulfill is improving your own craft to be able to teach the next class more effectively and efficiently.</p>
          
          <p>Learning programming languages has been an opportunity to test my ability to process information and self-teaching skills.
          I love to keep my hands and my mind busy and learning through attempting and completing little projects has done wonders for
          keeping my mind sharp in the past few years. I hope to someday turn this hobby into a "bread and butter."</p>
          
          <p>One thing that was missing from my work in education was the feeling of having made something with my own two hands. Figuratively, students are "the product" when working in education.
          Educators do mold students mind, so to speak, but your one or two classes with a student is just a drop in the bucket when you consider how much time
          and growth students go through in their time in academia. While being a mentor and a parental figure that students can look up to can be fulfilling, at the end of the day I've
          realized that I don't like having to convince myself that I've done a good job. sometimes you make a difference in someone's life, but a lot of times you don't.</p>
          
          <p>What they don't tell you going into education is that
          building a rapport and being someone people can rely on hurts when it has to end. Imagine raising someone else's child for a couple of years. You care about this person's safety and wellbeing. You care
          about their happiness. You want the best for them. They're family. Then tomorrow they're gone. It hurts. Now imagine that situation ninty times over every year. It's exhausting and from a professional standpoint
          it's kind of unfulfilling having the uncertainty in the back of your mind "Did I do a good job? Will this person go on to be a funcitoning member of society? Will they be treated fairly?" 
          Not everyone makes it and it can be heavy on the mind. It makes you wonder if it was worth the effort. I want work where I can see with my own two eyes that my effort hasn't gone to waste as well as being able to keep my sanity.</p>

          <p>Taking a step back, at every job I've worked up to this point I've made the same joke. They asked "What do you do for a living?" I responded "I run marathons everyday." because I worked myself to the bone. I worked beyond exhaustion, mentally, physically, or both.
          What's the point of pushing yourself until you get sick over and over if you have nothing to show for your effort?
          </p>
          
          <h2>Now</h2>
          <p>At the very least I want something in the work with my name attached to it. I've realized I want to work in a career where I can point to something tangable, physical or digital and non-human, and say "I made that." 
          I hope that someday I can have a library of programs I've written or products I've contributed to that I can look back on. I want to be part of something that can be preserved. I want something I can show my grandkids.
          I've known a lot of artists and musicians over the years that resent looking at their old work to the point where it doesn't matter how much praise they get, they hate all of 1it. They can't stand the sight of it.</p>
          I want the good and the bad. I want to leave my mark somewhere.
         
          The skills I have now and this portfolio site may not be much, but things take time. You try new things, you make mistakes, you learn from them, you grow and you improve.
          Someday I'll have more. Someday I'll be more than what I am now. As long as I go to sleep knowing I've made even a tiny bit of progress, I'm satisfied. Whether it's a big leap or a baby step towards improvement, it doesn't matter.
          Live today with the intention of being better than you were yesterday.</p>

          <p>Thank you for reading.</p>

    <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>I've been storing notes from various courses and lessons I've taken in a GitHub repository.
          Github repo pages are not known for being the most user friendly for everyone, so I wanted to
          make a personal site for my programming notes and projects that hopefully will be easier to comb through.

    <h2>Python AI for identifying notes in a song's melody</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>train AI to identify pitches and lengths of pitches</li>
          <li>use pitch/note data to generate usable midi files for DAW software</li>
          <br>
          <li>Starting point: train AI to identify one note/pitch (e.g. A#, Bb, etc.)
            <ul>
                <li>dataset should include sound samples from the same pitch being
                    played by a variety of different sources (traditional instruments,
                    midi digital instruments, different voices, instruments that
                    have effects applied [e.g. delay, reverb, chorus, phasers])
                </li>
                <li>datasets should contain identical pitches that are being 
                    played for different durations, from extremely short 64th notes to
                    notes that last for multiple bars/measures
                </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Python AI map generator for other planets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>"What would it look like if humans built cities on the moon? On Mars?"</li>
          <li>I want an AI that will be trained to create hypothetical
            human-civilization-like maps on other planets, 
            moons, solid heavenly bodies.</li>
          <br>
            <li>Starting point: train AI to generate fictional roadmaps based on
                Earth maps.
            </li>
          <li>Then train AI to adjust maps based on terrain, elevation</li>
          
        </ul>

    <h1>Self project: FFMPEG video cut GUI project</h1>
    <h2>Problem: using video editing software to cut video clips can be time consuming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cutting video (i.e. saving a small portion of a large video file as its own video clip)
            using video editing software can take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour depending on the length of the video clip you are trying
            to make and how long the original video is.
        </li>
        <li>Video editing software by default reencodes video before you can save the clip as a video file 
            outside of your project file.
        </li>
        <li>Reencoding video is unecessarily time consuming if you aren't making any meaningful edits to the clip being produced.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Solution: Use FFMPEG to cut video without reencoding.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>FFMPEG can cut video without reencoding which usually takes *seconds.*</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subproblem: FFMPEG must be run from commandline</h3>
    Using FFMPEG on Windows PC
    <ol>
        <li>open commandline</li>
        <li>change directory to ffmpeg.exe's location [cd users/username/videos/ffmpeg.exe]</li>
        <li>open up my FFMPEG command notes .txt file</li>
        <li>copy + paste the name of the video file I want to cut into the prewritten FFMPEG command template code, twice. Once for the input location and once for the output location.</li>
        <li>change the ouput location's file name so it doesn't overwrite the original file. [video.mp4 >>> video-cut.mp4]</li>
        <li>play the video file to find times for the beginning and end of the portion I want to cut out.</li>
        <li>type in beginning and end times in the template code</li>
        <li>copy + paste ffmpeg command template code into commandline. Press Enter to run. Video outputs to same directory as FFMPEG.exe</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Subproblem's solution: make a GUI for cutting video via FFMPEG</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It would save a little more time to be able to just be able to open a GUI to run FFMPEG for this specific purpose
            since I do not use any of FFMPEG's other features.
        </li>
        <li>With a GUI, I could skip the steps where I open commandline and open the text file. Maybe two or three less instances of copy + paste-ing, which could save a minute or two.</li>

    </ul>
<h1>Program outline:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>use Python Tkinter</li>
    <li>4 text input boxes:
        <ol>
            <li>original video's file name </li>
            <li>start time of cut</li>
            <li>end time of cut</li>
            <li>ouput video clip's new file name</li>
        </ol> 
    </li>
    <li>button that runs program</li>
    <li>Store the text input into the input boxes as 4 string variables</li>
    <li>Have the FFMPEG command template written with fstrings that will accept each of the 4 variables</li>
    <li>Program runs FFMPEG from commandline and inputs the completed template command into FFMPEG to have it cut the video</li>
</ul>

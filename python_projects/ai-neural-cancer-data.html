    <h1>Using Python for webscraping</h1>
        <p>This is annotated code for an AI neural network style module that Uses
            Python pandas library, SciKitLearn, and TensorFlow Keras.
        <br>    
            The AI module is trained to determine if a tumor is malignant or benign
            based on tumor data within an Excel spreadsheet.

            I did not write this program. I was following a lesson. The purpose of this 
            page is more about my notes because I wanted a starting point as to understand how
            AI porgrams are written at a base level.</p>
